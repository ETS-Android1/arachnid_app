# ArachnID

This project provides a tool for identifying spiders found within the home. This project provides an Android application with which the user can photograph a spider and receive immediate information about that spider’s species, venom status, and habitat. The identification software is based on a Convolutional Neural Network trained on images of North Carolinian spiders, allowing for automatic species classification

## Installation and Usage

This repository supplies the project's APK file, found in app/release/Arachnid-release.apk. It has been tested and confirms compatibility with Android version 8.0, “Oreo”, and above.
When using the Android Studio emulator, a test image hosted [here](https://www.arachnid.app/static/test_array.png) can be used in the simulated environment to test functionality of the app on the four identifiable species.
